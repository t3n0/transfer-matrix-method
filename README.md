This tool implements the transfer matrix method (TMM) to describe the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves in stacked layered materials at normal incidence. It uses a 4x4 matrix formalism which can account for the propagation of the EM fields with both x and y components. The EM waves are described using the [Jones vector formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_calculus). This allows the user to study the behaviour of the system with respect to the polarisation of light. Also, any layer can be arbitrary rotated by a given angle, thus allowing to study complex responses such as linear and/or circular [dichroism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichroism).

## Roadmap

The project is stable enough to deserve a release and offers the basic capabilities of the transfer matrix method. However, several improvements are on the making and will include:
 - a more efficient and versatile input file for scripting;
 - a routine to perform the removal of echos between layers;
 - a routine to calculate linear and circular dichroism;
 - the possibility of using different unit of measures (wavelength vs. frequency vs. energy);
 - an integration with the [RefractiveIndex](https://refractiveindex.info/) database, which provides the necessary optical constants.
